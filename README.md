# radisson-hotel-monthly-analysis-dashboard

## 1. Problem Statement

Radisson Hotel management required a clear, single-view analytical system to understand monthly business performance across countries, room types, and booking channels. The key challenges were:

* Lack of visibility into **profit and revenue contribution by country**
* Difficulty identifying **most profitable room categories**
* No consolidated insight into **booking source performance** (Corporate, Online, Travel Agent, Walk-in)
* Inability to monitor **daily revenue fluctuations** for operational planning

These limitations made it difficult to optimize pricing, improve channel strategy, and maximize profitability.
